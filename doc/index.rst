Welcome to HyML's documentation!
================================

HyML (acronym for Hy Markup Language) is a set of macros to generate XML, 
XHTML, and HTML code in `Hy <http://hy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

`HyML MiNiMaL <http://hyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html>`__ macro 
is departed from the more extensive document and validation oriented "full" 
version of HyML. HyML MiNiMaL is meant to be used as a minimal codebase 
to generate XML (Extensible Markup Language).
