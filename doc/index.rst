Welcome to HyML's documentation!
================================

`HyML <https://github.com/markomanninen/hyml>`__ (acronym for Hy Markup
Language) is a set of macros to generate XML, XHTML, and HTML code in
Hy.

HyML ``MiNiMaL`` macro is departed from the more extensive document and
validation oriented "full" version of HyML. HyML ``MiNiMaL`` is meant to be
used as a minimal codebase to generate XML (Extensible Markup Language).
