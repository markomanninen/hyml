HyML - XML / (X)HTML generator for Hy
=====================================


Introduction
------------

HyML (acronym for Hy Markup Language) is a set of macros to generate XML, XHTML, and HTML code in Hy. Main features are:

1. resembling syntax with XML
2. ability to evaluate Hy program code on macro expansion
3. processing lists and templates
4. custom variables
5. tag validation and attribute minimizing with html4 and html5 macros
6. custom div, class, and id handlers for html

You can use HyML for:

* static xml/xhtml/html content and file generation
* generating html code for Jupyter Notebook for example
* attached it to the server for dynamic html output generation
* practice and study
* challenge your imagination

If you want to skip the nostalgic background rationale part, you can jump straight to the `installation <http://hyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation>`__ and the `documentation <http://hyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation>`__ part.
